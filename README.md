# KERNEL-POPPER

Kernel-popper is a package designed to be compatible with scikit-learn's KernelRidge regression models; it calculates primary (feature) weights from the dual (sample) weights learnt by the model. This allows analysis and interpretation of the relationships that the model is using to make predictions. 

A paper describing the calculation is in progress. We will update a link here on publication.

## Get started

### PYPi

The package will shortly be available via `pip`. We will update this section with instructions.

### Requirements

The following dependencies are required to use the package:

```
  - numpy=2.3.3
  - python=3.13.7
  - scikit-learn=1.7.2
  - tqdm=4.67.1
```

## Use

See the `test_and_plot.ipynb` notebook for detailed examples of testing and using the package.
